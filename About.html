 <h2>10 of the World’s Most Endangered Animals in 2023</h2>
<p>Hundreds of thousands of animals around the world are threatened by human action and climate change and are in need of protection and conservation efforts. Join us we take a look at the top 10 most endangered animals in the world in 2023</p>
<p>1. Amur Leopard
    First on the list of the world’s most endangered animals in 2022 is the amur leopard. Between 2014 and 2015, only around 92 individuals were 
    left in their natural range. This number is now estimated to be around 84. They are extremely vulnerable to poachers, who kill them for their
     coats and bones, the latter of which is sold for use in traditional Asian medicine. They are at risk of habitat loss due to natural and man-made 
     fires. Climate change is also leading to a decrease in prey availability.</p>
    
   <p> 2. Rhino
    Rhinos are one of the most poached animals on the planet. Their horns are used in traditional Chinese medicine and displayed as a symbol and demonstration
     of wealth. A Javan rhino horn can sell for up to USD$30,000 per kg on the black market. Because of poaching, three of the five species of rhinos are among 
     the most endangered animals in 2022: the black rhino, the Javan rhino and the Sumatran rhino. The Javan rhino is the closest to extinction with only around 
     60 individuals left, all of which are in Ujung Kulon National Park in Indonesia, while black rhino population is estimated to be around 5,500 individuals.</p>
